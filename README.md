Repository containing the CIF submission for Enrollment System Modernization Phase 2, DG*5.3*985 and IVM*2.0*188 (DG_53_P985.KID) received Sep 2019.

The Enrollment System Modernization Phase 2 project will continue to define health benefit plan(s) for which a Client (Veteran, Service member, and beneficiary) is eligible and ties them to the authority for care. These are derived from Client enrollment applications, Military Service Information, rating decisions, financial information, and other eligibility factors. It supports the management of enrollment correspondence and telephone inquiries; shares eligibility and enrollment I information with other Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and non-VA (e.g., Department of Defense) organizations; and supports national reporting and analysis of VHA Enrollment data.
